# Girls-Inc
The purpose of this project was to analyze results from the 2019 Strong, Smart, Bold nationalsurvey.
Original data collected responses according to organizational classifications of 'Strong', 'Smart' and 'Bold'. 
The goal of the analysis was to connect organizational classifications to assigned key word indicators to identify areas of refinement for the program. 

The ipynb file is an example of data cleaning, exploration and plotting in Python.
The xlsx file is part of the organizational and analytics tool. 

Analysis is longitudinal but the included files are original analysis to-date.
